# Create a button component usable as a link (React)

A sample project of a UI component library in React.<br>
It's built with React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and Storybook.

The main feature is that components can be extended with `as` props.<br>
It helps create a component that looks like a button but functions as a link.

The implementation is based on Chakra UI. For a detailed explanation, please check the blog post.
